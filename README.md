# NVDA Stock analysis
ML-Project is a project in which I scraped data from yahoo finance and loaded the data into a local MySQL server on my machine. Connection between my python program and the database is done using SQLalchemy. The data is then used to plot a 5-year time series visualization and is also used to conduct volatility analysis of the NVDA share price. 

Current Tech Stack:
- Python, Selenium, Pandas for data extraction and manipulation
- Matplotlib is used for visualizations 
- MySQL and MySQL workbench serves as the database and database query tool
- SQLalchemy connects the python program to the local MySQL database

## Future Plans:
Performing futher stock price analysis on the dataset that I have scraped. This project serves as a base for me to explore other quantitative finance related projects, such as a real-time trading bot, algorithmic trading.
